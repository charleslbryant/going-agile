This is my attempt at writing a book. I decided to just chronicle my teams transformation into an agile software product delivery team. Let's see how it goes. This is taken from my perspective as a team member and not a manager. I am currently the Lead Automation Engineer on the team and my views are taken from my perspective in this position.

From the time I joined the team our delivery pipeline has included:

* Planning
* Developing
* Building
* Deploying
* Testing
* Releasing
* Monitoring

How we actually did each of these has changed during our going agile journey. Throughout this book I will strive to explain how our process has evolved in respect to each of these steps in our delivery pipeline. 

For me going agile has meant embracing the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), the [twelve agile principles](http://www.agilealliance.org/the-alliance/the-agile-manifesto/the-twelve-principles-of-agile-software/), [continuous improvement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process) and [Kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen). Since I am throwing around buzz words it can't hurt to mention that my love affair with [continuous delivery](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html) and [devops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) has greatly influenced my personal experience in our going agile story.

If your team is just embarking on your going agile experience, it helps to understand that there will be many ups and downs, successes and failures, but through it all realize that this is to be expected. Learning from failures is how you improve and if you are doing it right you will never stop failing and your "Going Agile" story will be never ending.
