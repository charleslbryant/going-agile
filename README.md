This is my attempt at writing a book. I decided to just chronicle my teams transformation into an agile software product delivery team. Let's see how it goes. This is taken from my perspective as a team member and not a manager. I am currently the Lead Automation Engineer on the team and my views are taken from my perspective in this position.

From the time I joined the team our delivery process has included:

* Planning
* Developing
* Building
* Deploying
* Testing
* Releasing
* Monitoring

How we actually did each of these has changed during our going agile journey.
