#Introduction

This is my attempt at writing a book. I decided to just chronicle my teams transformation into an agile software product delivery team. Let's see how it goes. This is taken from my perspective as a team member and not a manager. I am currently the Lead Automation Engineer on the team and my views are taken from my perspective in this position.

##Going Agile

From the time I joined the team our delivery pipeline has included:

* Planning
* Developing
* Building
* Deploying
* Testing
* Releasing
* Monitoring

How we actually did each of these has changed during our going agile journey. Throughout this book I will strive to explain how our process has evolved in respect to each of these steps in our delivery pipeline. 

For me going agile has meant embracing the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), the [twelve agile principles](http://www.agilealliance.org/the-alliance/the-agile-manifesto/the-twelve-principles-of-agile-software/), [continuous improvement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process) and [Kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen). Since I am throwing around buzz words it can't hurt to mention that my love affair with [continuous delivery](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html) and [devops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) has greatly influenced my personal experience in our going agile story. My love affair was sparked by a wonderful novel by [Gene Kim](http://itrevolution.com/authors/gene-kim/) titled the [Phoenix Project](http://www.amazon.com/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592).

##Going Agile Recommendation

If your team is just embarking on your going agile experience, it helps to understand that there will be many ups and downs, successes and failures. Through it all it helps reduce stress to realize that this is to be expected and you will most likely get it wrong. Learning from failures is how you improve and if you are going agile the right way you will never stop failing and your "Going Agile" story will be never ending.

My ultimate advice for teams looking to go agile is to just jump in. Don't spend months trying to plan it or understand it. If you don't have a total buy in from your company you can still agilize what you have control of. It's somewhat foolish in my eyes if you don't commit on some level to continuously improve. It could be as simple as understanding the agile manifesto, the twelve agile principles, and establishing a improvement kata. Take small steps and learn from each failure so you can improve in the next iteration. 

Have fun "Going Agile!"
